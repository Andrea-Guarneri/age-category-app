# Hi there! I'm Andrea Guarneri 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about **front-end development** and am currently focused on honing my skills in **JavaScript** through hands-on projects and exercises. Here, you’ll find a showcase of my journey in coding, problem-solving, and experimenting with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

## 💻 What I’m Currently Working On

I’m building a solid foundation in JavaScript by working on real-world solutions and adopting a professional approach to code. Below is one of the key projects I’m actively working on:

## 🧒 Age Category App 📊

**Age Category App** is a JavaScript application that classifies users into age ranges based on their inputted age. It displays the corresponding age category (like Baby, Teenager, Elderly), a dynamic image representing that age group, and changes the background color for a visually engaging experience. The app is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with built-in error handling for invalid age inputs.

### 🌐 Live Demo

You can test and view this app directly on Netlify: [Age Category App](https://age-category.netlify.app/)

### 🌟 Key Features

- **User Input**: Prompts users to enter their age via `prompt()`.
- **Dynamic Classification**: Determines and displays the user's age range along with a relevant image.
- **Error Handling**: Shows an error message and fallback image for invalid inputs.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Leverages Tailwind CSS for a clean, responsive design using utility-first classes.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updates the background color, image, and text based on the user's age.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless layout across various screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Skills

- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Writing modular, clean code while practicing key concepts.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Building structured, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing utility-first CSS for efficient and rapid UI development.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically altering page elements and styles based on user interactions.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing user-friendly error messages and fallback designs.
